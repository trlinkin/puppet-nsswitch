# nsswitch.conf module for Puppet

A way of expressing nsswitch.conf configurations declaratively. This
should cover the 15 basic databases NSS supports. 

### Defaults

Currenly this module has support for RedHat, CentOS, Amazon Linux, and
Ubuntu. This module at its very basic will create an nsswitch.conf that
uses defaults derived from the distrobution provided nsswitch.conf file.
These defaults have been verified on the mentioned Distrobutions.

### Supported Systems
This module should be capable of supporting the following systems:
 * Debian/Ubuntu
 * RHEL (Centos, RHEL6.x, Amazon)
 * Fedora

Testing has only confirmed functionality on the following:
  * Centos 6.x
  * Ubuntu 12.4

### Usage

## Example nsswitch.conf with all defaults for RHEL systems.

   # This file is controlled by Puppet

    passwd:     files
    shadow:     files
    group:      files
    hosts:      files dns
    bootparams: nisplus [NOTFOUND=return] files
    ethers:     files
    netmasks:   files
    networks:   files
    protocols:  files
    rpc:        files
    services:   files
    netgroup:   nisplus
    publickey:  nisplus
    automount:  files nisplus
    aliases:    files nisplus

## nsswitch class

This is the class by which you will manage the nsswitch.conf file. There
is one paramter per standard database NSS supports. The class accepts both strings 
and arrays as paramters. The benefit being, you could possibly merge an array
of options with hiera. When using an array, each element should be the
lookup service followed by the reaction statement.

Available parameters are:

* passwd
* group
* shadow
* hosts
* bootparams
* aliases
* automount
* ethers
* netgroup
* netmasks
* network
* protocols
* publickey
* rpc
* services


For more information on NSS, please see the man pages. `man 5 nsswitch.conf`

## Examples

    # defaults only
    include nsswitch

    # setting a simple lookup
    class { 'nsswitch':
      publickey => 'nis',
    }

    # 'hosts' lookups contain a reaction statement for the 'dns' service
    class { 'nsswitch':
      passwd => ['ldap','files'],
      hosts  => ['dns [!UNAVAIL=return]','files'],
    }
